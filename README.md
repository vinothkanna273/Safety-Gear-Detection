# Safety-Gear-Detection
   Safety-Gear-Detection is an Machine Learning project that detects safety vests and helmets worn by construction workers using YOLOv8.

## Description
   The project aims to improve workplace safety in construction environments by leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques. By accurately detecting safety gear in real-time, it helps to reduce the risk of accidents and promotes a culture of well-being.

## Features
* Real-time detection of safety vests and helmets
* High accuracy and efficiency using YOLOv8
* Supports video input for continuous monitoring

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/vinothkanna273/Safety-Gear-Detection.git
2. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Run the ML image classification script: python main.py 
2. Provide the video file path or use the default camera input.
3. The script will process the video frames, detect safety vests and helmets, and display the results in real-time.

## Model
The ML model used in this project is included in the repository. It has been trained using annotated construction worker images to achieve accurate detection.

## Example
You can find an example video in the repository (ppe-1.mp4). Feel free to use it to test the project and observe the detection results.
